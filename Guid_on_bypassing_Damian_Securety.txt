Hello Everyone in this Document we will discust on how to abuse the Securety vounerabyletys 
that our beloved Damian diden't patch.

Note: If Damian trys to patch somthing check back on the document in 2-5 buissnes days a fix
for the problem will be found by me.

First Damian doesen't block websites wich means we can dowload Games from Steamunlocked.org ,
or for anime fans hianime.to is not blocked either 


Now lets discused said bypassing methods:

1. Probably the best one is Scoop (# Link to scoop) it allows you to install steam with the anticheat 
so playing games like CS in non bot lobbis is possible 

Guide for scoop: go to the website that is linked up there then open Powershell and input the
command on the website into powershell. (if u dont know what any of that is this guide is not ment for u)
after installing scoop u can search on the scoop website for things like steam or other tools 
some will still require admininstrativ rights but steam and Heroic (opensourc launcher for epic blizard and Ubisoft)

2. In the Repo u will have found a batch file when opening the batch will u will see this command:
cmd /min /C "set __COMPAT_LAYER=RUNASINVOKER && start "" "Your path"

Where it says "Your path" delet out only the Your path the collans have to stay for it to work.
this can be used to semi bypass admin rights restricions for apps not able to be installed via scoop

Limitations: It does not work with wizard installers so no epic games or any other programm that uses a wizard installer
scoop is more powerfull becous dowloads a type of portable version of the prgramm so no edits in the regestry editor have to
be made.

3. Microsoft store, Probably one of the less usfull one
but the microsoft store has rights and installs a diffrent version for most prgramms then the official 
installer of them (dont use MS store python, only if absolutly necssesary) 


Knows issues: (if u find any i am unaware of pleas contact me via Laurin.Asmin@gmail.com DO NOT use your school email use a personal one)

1. Offizial Roblox not working. Its being flaged by Cortex XDR
2. Minecraft launcher requiering admin rights. if it has not been installed befor that fix.

Fixes:
1. The offizial Roblox installer works but after its installed it will get flaged at launch and preventet
by Cortex. For fixing this issue dowload Roblox from the MS store due it dowloading a diffrent version it works.

3. All 3rd party launchers are banned by cortex
