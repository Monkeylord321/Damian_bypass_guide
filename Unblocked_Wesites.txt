Here we will discuss unbanned websites for game piracy, anime piracy, and for our gooners, how to watch porn on the school laptop.

Game piracy: Steamunlocked.org, it contains essentially every steam game. The only downside is the download speed; unless you pay, it will be diabolically slow.

I recommend leaving the laptop on overnight to download the file. 

Note when clicking on download it will take you to some random ad websites; the correct one is download heaven. Any others contain malware.

Anime Piracy. If you have to watch animes offlien i recommend searching for your anime on archive.org or get the free opensource Torrentdowloader like

qbitorrent and use https://nyaa.si/; my personal favorite anime pirating website has everything.

if you happen to have a wifi connection its smarter to go for something like hianime.to make it easier to navigate and watch anime.

For even more tutorials, go on r/animepiracy.

For all degenerates out here. If you want a foolproof way of watching porn, go on OnWorks; it's an online emulator that allows you to use the internet via the servers of OnWorks. So all they can track is that you are using OnWorks.

Other ways include

1. Anime
