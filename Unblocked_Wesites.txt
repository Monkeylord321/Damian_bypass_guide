Here we will discuss unbanned websites for game piracy, Software piracy, anime piracy, and for our gooners, how to watch porn on the school laptop.

For software piracy, we have getintopc.com. I do not recommend downloading from there because the school's antivirus flags, blocks, and reports it. But I can personally assure you that it's no virus; the reason is because of the way the programs check if they have been pirated, and the changes that have been made to these files and programs include changing the behavior to something that gets flagged as suspicious by the antivirus Cortex. 


Game piracy: Steamunlocked.org, it contains essentially every steam game. The only downside is the download speed; unless you pay, it will be diabolically slow.
I recommend leaving the laptop on overnight to download the file. 
Note when clicking on download, it will take you to some random ad websites; the correct one is Download Heaven. Any others contain malware.


Anime Piracy. If you have to watch anime offline, I recommend searching for your anime on archive.org or getting the free open-source torrent downloader like
qbittorrent and use https://nyaa.si/; my personal favorite anime pirating website has everything.
If you happen to have a wifi connection, it's smarter to go for something like Hianime. to make it easier to navigate and watch anime.
For even more tutorials, go on r/animepiracy.


For all degenerates out here. If you want a foolproof way of watching porn on the school laptop, go on OnWorks; it's an online emulator that allows you to use the internet via the servers of OnWorks. So all they can track is that you are using OnWorks.
Other ways include
1. Anime
2. @Leon continue
